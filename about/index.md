I am **Ritesh Agrawal** working as Software Engineer at *HackerEarth*.
Currently I am contributing to improve [Practice
Section](https://hackerearth.com/practice/){: target="_blank"}. I use Python
for most of the work and like it very much.


I also developed webapp [kunalsir.in](http://kunalsir.in){: target="_blank"}. This webapp aims to
feciliitate CA students in their exam preparation. It was developed using
Django (Web framework for Python) and hosted on google app engine. 

Software development is my work as well as my hobby. I like to explore new
technologies, tools. etc. I also have keen interest in cyber security and
currently learning its fundamentals.

I am currently living in Bangalore. I also like to attend various python and
security meetups.
